# hello-git
for trying features in git

Open source is a good thing but in some cases it is a bad thing.
One can use some ready programmes for doing projects by editting and modifying.
It is not a great idea to put a complete project for public for no reason.
People who do not know why and what is git and open source philosophy are not recommended to upload their entire work online.
