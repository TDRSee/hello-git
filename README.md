# hello-git
for trying features in git

Open source is a good thing but in some cases it is a bad thing.
One can use some ready program for doing projects by editing and modifying.
It is not a great idea to put a complete project for public for no reason.
People who do not know why and what is git and open source philosophy (I DID spell it correctly) are not recommended to upload their entire work online.
